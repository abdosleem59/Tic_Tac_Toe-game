# Tic Tac Toe console game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This game allows you to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a customizable grid size.

The default grid size is 3x3, but you can play on a larger grid if you prefer.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you will be prompted to enter the grid size.
2. Players take turns to enter their move. The game will prompt you to enter the row and column number where you want to place your mark (X or O).
3. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move. If there's a win or a tie, the game will display the result and end. If the game is ongoing, it will continue to prompt players for their moves.
